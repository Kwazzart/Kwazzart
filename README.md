Hello, I am an analytics student from Moscow. I am interested in data-science, data/product/marketing-analysis, product-management and lean-startups. Here is some information about me

## Projects and achievements:
- Kaggle's Housing Prices competition, top 5% solutions. Solving a regression problem using 79 predictors (ensambles, catboost, lightgbm). In this competition, I implemented the entire pipeline (data cleaning, EDA, feature generation, feature selection, modeling, building ensamble)

- Winning the case championship, best solution for developing a transportation company's strategy (time-series market forecasting). In this case study, I played the role of key analyst, developed key strategies, predicted demand for transportation company services and developed a financial model of alternatives
